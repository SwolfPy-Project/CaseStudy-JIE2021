Case Study with SwolfPy
========================

This case study was implemented to illustrate the functionality of SwolfPy for SWM system analysis.
The case study first evaluated the global warming potential (GWP) of the SWM system in a hypothetical
but realistic city and then used the optimization functionality to minimize the GWP and meet a landfill
diversion target of 40%. Monte Carlo simulation was used to explore the robustness of the results to
the uncertainty in input data.
